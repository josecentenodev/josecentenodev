# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jose Centeno
## About me?
Hello! I'm Jose, a passionate full-stack developer. My journey began in 2017 when I took the reins of my education and delved into the fascinating world of development through self-learning.
I am currently part of a dedicated team working on large-scale projects using any kind of technologies.

I'm really passionate about clean architecture and writing clean, maintainable code.

## Challenges and Achievements
I've faced exciting challenges. I am involved in all stages, from initial design to code execution, with a focus on creating scalable and high-quality projects. Another notable aspect of my journey has been the creation and enhancement of interfaces using Material UI. I specialize in refactor and adapting the components of libraries to suit the specific needs of the project, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience. My approach is focused on problem-solving, always keeping SOLID principles as a guide for development.

## Goals

My long-term goal is to contribute to the evolution of the community, inspiring others to overcome labor market challenges and grow together. I plan to achieve this through the construction of standout projects and fostering the personal and professional growth of those around me.
